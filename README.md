# bioactivity_predictior


## Reproducing this web application
To recreate this web app on your own computer, do the following.

### Create conda environment
Firstly, we will create a conda environment called *bioactivity*
```
conda create -n bioactivity python=3.7.9
```
Secondly, we will login to the *bioactivity* environement
```
conda activate bioactivity
```
### Install prerequisite libraries

Download requirements.txt file

```
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/naveenverse/bioactivity_predictior/main/requirements.txt

```

Pip install libraries
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Building ML model

The machine learning model used in this web app will firstly have to be generated by successfully running the included Jupyter notebook [bioactivity_prediction_app.ipynb](https://github.com/naveenverse/bioactivity_model/blob/main/model_building.ipynb). You can train the model on dataset of your interest and save it as a `.pkl` file.

###  Launch the app

```
streamlit run app.py
```
